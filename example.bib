DR2 covers the entirety of the sky available from the William E. Gordon 305 m antenna at Arecibo, from decl. −1°17′ to decl. + 37°57′ across all R.A.: 4 steradians or 32% of the sky. DR2 differs in a number of ways from data release 1, which was released in 2011. DR2 is built from a largely separate set of observations from DR1, which were taken in a much more consistent mode. This consistency, coupled with more careful attention to systematics and more advanced data reduction algorithms, leads to a much higher-quality DR2 data product. We present three data sets for public use: H i data cubes, far-sidelobe stray-radiation-corrected column density maps, and results of the Rolling Hough Transform linear feature detection algorithm.}

  abstract={The local interstellar medium (ISM) is suffused with “dark” gas, identified by excess infrared and gamma-ray emission, yet undetected by standard ISM tracers such as neutral hydrogen (H i ) or carbon monoxide emission. Based on observed dust properties from Planck , recent studies have argued that H i mixed with dust is strongly saturated and that dark gas is dominated by optically thick H i . We test this hypothesis by reproducing this model using data from Planck and new 21 cm emission maps from GALFA-H i —the first large-area 21 cm emission survey with comparable angular resolution to Planck . We compare the results with those from a large sample of H i column densities based on direct observations of H i optical depth, and find that the inferred column density corrections are significantly lower than those inferred by the Planck -based model. Further, we rule out the hypothesis that the pencil-beam H i absorption sight lines preferentially miss opaque “blobs” with small covering fraction, as these structures require densities and pressures that are incompatible with ISM conditions. Our results support the picture that excess dust emission in the local ISM is not dominated by optically thick H i , but is rather a combination of intrinsic changes in dust grain emissivities and H 2 missed by CO observations.}

  abstract={Observations of interstellar dust are often used as a proxy for total gas column density N H . By comparing Planck thermal dust data (Release 1.2) and new dust reddening maps from Pan-STARRS 1 and 2MASS, with accurate (opacity-corrected) H i column densities and newly published OH data from the Arecibo Millennium survey and 21-SPONGE, we confirm linear correlations between dust optical depth τ 353 , reddening E ( B − V ), and the total proton column density N H in the range (1–30) × 10 20 cm −2 , along sightlines with no molecular gas detections in emission. We derive an N H / E ( B − V ) ratio of (9.4 ± 1.6) × 10 21 cm −2 mag −1 for purely atomic sightlines at ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/862/1/49/apjaac82bieqn1.gif] {$| b| \gt 5^\circ $} , which is 60% higher than the canonical value of Bohlin et al. We report a ∼40% increase in opacity σ 353 = τ 353 / N H , when moving from the low column density ( N H < 5 × 10 20 cm −2 ) to the moderate column density ( N H > 5 × 10 20 cm −2 ) regime, and suggest that this rise is due to the evolution of dust grains in the atomic interstellar medium. Failure to account for H i opacity can cause an additional apparent rise in σ 353 of the order of a further ∼20%. We estimate molecular hydrogen column densities ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/862/1/49/apjaac82bieqn2.gif] {${N}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$} from our derived linear relations, and hence derive the OH/H 2 abundance ratio of X OH ∼ 1 × 10 −7 for all molecular sightlines. Our results show no evidence of systematic trends in OH abundance with ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/862/1/49/apjaac82bieqn3.gif] {${N}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$} in the range ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/862/1/49/apjaac82bieqn4.gif] {${N}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$}  ∼ (0.1−10) × 10 21 cm −2 . This suggests that OH may be used as a reliable proxy for H 2 in this range, which includes sightlines with both CO-dark and CO-bright gas.}

Maps of the clouds were constructed from Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer ( WISE ) data and directly compared with the maps of dust optical depth from Planck . The mid-infrared emission per unit dust optical depth has a significant trend toward lower values at higher optical depths. The trend can be quantitatively explained by the extinction of starlight within the clouds. The relative amounts of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and very small grains traced by WISE , compared with large grains tracked by Planck , are consistent with being constant. The temperature of the large grains significantly decreases for clouds with larger dust optical depth; this trend is partially due to dust property variations, but is primarily due to extinction of starlight. We updated the prediction for molecular hydrogen column density, taking into account variations in dust properties, and find it can explain the observed dust optical depth per unit gas column density. Thus, the low gas-to-dust ratios in the clouds are most likely due to “dark gas” that is molecular hydrogen.}

  abstract={A peculiar infrared ring-like structure was discovered by Spitzer around the strongly magnetized neutron star SGR 1900+14. This infrared (IR) structure was suggested to be due to a dust-free cavity, produced by the Soft Gamma-ray Repeaters (SGRs) Giant Flare occurring in 1998, and kept illuminated by surrounding stars. Using a 3D dust radiative transfer code, we aimed to reproduce the emission morphology and the integrated emission flux of this structure assuming different spatial distributions and densities for the dust, and different positions for the illuminating stars. We found that a dust-free ellipsoidal cavity can reproduce the shape, flux, and spectrum of the ring-like IR emission, provided that the illuminating stars are inside the cavity and that the interstellar medium has high gas density ( n H ∼ 1000 cm −3 ). We further constrain the emitting region to have a sharp inner boundary and to be significantly extended in the radial direction, possibly even just a cavity in a smooth molecular cloud. We discuss possible scenarios for the formation of the dustless cavity and the particular geometry that allows it to be IR-bright.}

  abstract={The content of interstellar clouds, in particular the inventory of diffuse molecular gas, remains uncertain. We identified a sample of isolated clouds, approximately 100 M ⊙ in size, and used the dust content to estimate the total amount of gas. In Paper I, the total inferred gas content was found significantly larger than that seen in 21 cm emission measurements of H i . In this paper we test the hypothesis that the apparent excess “dark” gas is cold H i , which would be evident in absorption but not in emission due to line saturation. The results show that there is not enough 21 cm absorption toward the clouds to explain the total amount of “dark” gas.}

  abstract={Small-scale features observed by Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe ( WMAP ) and PLANCK in the frequency range of 22–90 GHz show a nearly flat spectrum, which meets with expectations that they originate in the early universe. However, free–free emission from electrons in small angular scale galactic sources that suffer beam dilution very closely mimic the observed spectrum in this frequency range. Fitting such a model to the PLANCK and WMAP data shows that the angular size required to fit the data is comparable to the angular width of associated H i filaments found in the Galactic Arecibo L-Band Feed Array-H i survey data. Also, the temperature of the electrons is found to be in the range of 100–300 K. The phenomenon revealed by these data may contribute to a more precise characterization of the foreground masks required to interpret the cosmological aspect of PLANCK and WMAP data.}

  abstract={We develop a model of dust evolution in a multiphase, inhomogeneous interstellar medium (ISM) using hydrodynamical simulations of giant molecular clouds in a Milky Way–like spiral galaxy. We improve the treatment of dust growth by accretion in the ISM to investigate the role of the temperature-dependent sticking coefficient and ion–grain interactions.

This relation requires a sticking coefficient that decreases with the gas temperature. The relation predicted by the models reproduces the slope of −0.5 for the observed relation in cold clouds, which is steeper than that for the warm medium and is explained by dust growth. We find that growth occurs in the cold medium for all adopted values of the minimum grain size a min from 1 to 5 nm.

The rates of dust re-formation in the ISM by far exceed the rates of dust production by stellar sources. After the initial 140 Myr, the cycle of matter in and out of dust reaches a steady state, in which the dust growth balances the destruction on a similar timescale of 350 Myr.}
